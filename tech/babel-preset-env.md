npm WARN deprecated babel-preset-es2015@6.24.1: We're super ? excited that you'

re trying to use ES2015 syntax, but instead of making more yearly presets ? , Ba

bel now has a better preset that we recommend you use instead: npm install babel

-preset-env --save-dev. preset-env without options will compile ES2015+ down to

ES5 just like using all the presets together and thus is more future proof. It a

lso allows you to target specific browsers so that Babel can do less work and yo

u can ship native ES2015+ to user ? ! We are also in the process of releasing v7

, so please give http://babeljs.io/blog/2017/09/12/planning-for-7.0 a read and h

elp test it out in beta! Thanks so much for using Babel ?, please give us a foll
